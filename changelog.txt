Code_CallbackPlayerSay*: Added 2nd argument (to entity)

August 11 2013
Code_CallbackPlayerSay*: 2nd argument = boolean teamchat -> false: toall true: onlyteam


Hmm I was too lazy to write anything...

February 3 2014:

CodeCallback_PlayerSayCmd is removed.
CodeCallback_PlayerSayAll is renamed to CodeCallback_PlayerSay.
CodeCallback_ScriptCommand added as well as script function: addscriptcommand()

Fixed an issue that cheatprotected cvars got no reset on level startup which caused strange effects on Deathrun mod with bg_falldamage cvars.

June 22 2014:
Removed chat trap for script when a command gets invoked.
Use CodeCallback_ScriptCommand and addscriptcommand() instead  (see scriptcommand_example.txt)

Added securemode which should prevent breaking out of cod4 server into shell.


June 29 2014:
Removed the non working recusion callback function for player's chat. Use plugins instead.

July 27 2014:
exec() script function now returns the result as string truncated - Maybe this functionality getting removed later again if issues arise

September 09 2014:
exec is now execex
exec works like before July 27 2014

September 12 2016:
After a 2 years its still good to write about changes in server code ^^
 - 'SetText' script command now safe to use with dynamically created strings like player names, number increments and etc.
 - 'ClearAllTextAfterHudElem' script command now can be used only in developer mode because of its bugs.

September 13 2016:
 + Added 'Scr_AddArrayKey' script and plugin function. It allows you to create script arrays with string keys instead of numeric. Just make sure you passed value returned from 'Scr_AllocString' (call this one on initialization).
